        <blockquote>
          "...so bright was Rothinzil that even at morning Men could see it glimmering in the West, and in the cloudless night it shone alone, for now other star could stand beside it. And setting their course towards it the Edain came at last over leagues of sea and saw afar the land that was prepared for them, Andor, the Land of Gift, shimmering in a golden haze. Then they went up out of the sea and found a country fair and fruitful, and they were glad. And they called that land Elenna, which is Starwards; but also Anad&#251;n&#234;, which is Westernesse, N&uacute;men&oacute;r&#235; in the High Eldarin tongue."
